# Matlab-code-for-the-similarity-solution-of-water-entry-of-a-wedge
This is a matlab code for the similarity solution based on the Wagner function. The code can calculate the results of water entry of a wedge with all deadrise angles. The code is done by Xueliang Wen, Peiqing Liu and Qiulin Qu from Key Laboratory of Aero-Acoustics, Beihang University(BUAA), Beijing, China. The theory of the code and the numerical stagedies are from the following literatures:  1.Z. N. Dobrovol’Skaya, On some problems of similarity flow of fluid with a free surface, Journal of Fluid Mechanics 36 (4) (1969) 805–829.    2.J. Wang, O. M. Faltinsen, Improved numerical solution of dobrovol'skaya's boundary integral equations on similarity flow for uniform symmetrical entry of wedges, Applied Ocean Research 66 (2017) 23–31.  It must be mentioned that I am not the first guy of the method. Any guy whos wants to quote the results from the code, please cite the above literatures.
